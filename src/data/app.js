Missions can include taking a photo of a registered area (like your kitchen sink), solving complex math problems, or scanning a barcode (like your toothpaste tube). This forces physical movement and mental engagement right at wake-up time.

If you struggle with oversleeping, Alarmy is the last alarm clock you'll ever need. It guarantees you are out of bed and mentally active, ready to start the day on time.`,
