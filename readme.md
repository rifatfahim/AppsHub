I created a responsive Hero IO web application using React and Vite for Programming 
hero Assignment.
The app includes a header with logo, navigation links, and a GitHub contribution button.
I designed a custom footer and structured the app data as a JavaScript array of objects.
The Home Page has a banner, three state cards, and a top apps section with clickable app cards.
The All Apps Page displays all apps with a live search feature and shows a “No App Found” message if no match exists.
Each app has an App Details Page showing image, title, ratings, downloads, description, and an Install button.
I implemented charts using Recharts to visualize app reviews on the details page.
Installed apps are saved in localStorage, and the “My Installation” page allows uninstalling apps with a toast notification.
I added loading animations for page navigation and search operations, and created a custom error page for invalid routes.
Finally, I deployed the project to Vercel ensuring all routes work without errors.
